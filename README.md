## Support

Your GPU likely supports subgroups operations, but likely does not support float atomics ([list of GPUs which support float atomics](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listdevicescoverage.php?extension=VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float)), this is why I don't use them.

- `GL_EXT_shader_atomic_float`: Inter-workgroup reduction. To return 1 sum, max, etc. instead of 1 for each workgroup.
- `GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic`: Fast intra-workgroup reduction. To get sum, max, etc. within a workgroup quickly.
