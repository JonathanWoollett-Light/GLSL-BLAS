# 🚧 EXTRME WIP 🚧

Everything but the GLSL files is a mess (and even the GLSL files are still rough).

## Support

Your GPU likely supports subgroups operations, but likely does not support float atomics ([list of GPUs which support float atomics](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listdevicescoverage.php?extension=VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float)). I am planning procedures for circumstance both with and without support for float atomics.

Library |  `GL_EXT_shader_atomic_float` | `GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic`
--- | --- | ---
[WebGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) | ❌ | ✔️
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) | ❌ | ❌

- `GL_EXT_shader_atomic_float`: Inter-workgroup reduction. To return 1 sum, max, etc. instead of 1 for each workgroup.
- `GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic`: Fast intra-workgroup reduction. To get sum, max, etc. within a workgroup quickly.

Both can be worked around, but awkwardly.

Neither are new, code shouldn't need to be made worse due to the lack of support here.
